If an ASUS ROG G713QM is crashing during Windows 11 installation (specifically during the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE)) and Out-of-Box updates, it's likely due to a hardware or software incompatibility, or potentially a BIOS issue. Here's a troubleshooting guide: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]

1. Verify Hardware Compatibility: [4]
SSD: The most likely culprit is the SSD itself. If you have another SSD, try installing Windows on that to see if the problem persists. [4]
RAM: Try booting with only one RAM stick at a time in different slots to isolate any RAM issues. [5, 6]
GPU: Try booting without your dedicated GPU (if you have one) to see if the instability disappears. [6, 7]

2. BIOS and UEFI Settings: [5, 5, 7, 7]
Clear CMOS: Clear the CMOS to reset the BIOS to factory defaults. This can sometimes resolve issues related to improper BIOS settings. [5, 5, 7, 7]
XMP/EXPO: Disable XMP/EXPO (if enabled) during the initial Windows install process, as overclocked RAM can cause instability. [7, 7, 8]
BIOS Update: Ensure you have the latest BIOS version for your ROG G713QM. [5, 5, 9, 9]

3. Software and Drivers: [10, 10]
Windows 11 Version: Consider trying an older version of Windows 11 (23H2 or 22H2) if the issue is specifically with the latest 24H2 update. [10, 10]
AsLogDumpTool: Use the AsLogDumpTool2.exe diagnostic tool in MyASUS to gather more information about the crash. [1, 1]
Drivers: If the issue persists after a clean install, it's possible that pre-installed ASUS drivers are interfering with the installation process. You can try installing Windows drivers from the Microsoft Update catalog or by letting Windows manage the drivers. [1, 1]

4. Other Troubleshooting: [7, 7]
USB Drive: Try using a different USB drive for the Windows installation media. [7, 7]
Disk Partitioning: If the PC crashes during Windows installation, try deleting all partitions on the target drive and letting the installer reformat it. [11, 11, 12, 12]
System Restore: If the crashes occur after installing updates, try restoring the system to a previous state before the updates. [13, 13, 14]

5. Contact Support: [15, 15]
ASUS Support: If you've exhausted these options, contact ASUS support for further assistance, especially if you suspect a hardware issue. [13, 15, 15, 16]
Microsoft Support: If the issue is related to Windows updates, contact Microsoft support. [3, 3]
