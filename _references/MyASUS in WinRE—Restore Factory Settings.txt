you also need to change the name of the boot disk to SYSTEM if it has changed. I was tormented by searching and barely fixed it. when renaming the C drive to OS, I also did not recover.

•
what boot disk should i rename to SYSTEM? recovery?

•
No, efi boot partition

•
I checked and it is ok, it is called system, but it still restarts and takes me to the desktop right after it says "check compatibility ok", ahy idea? please help me, this is driving me crazy.

•
Do you have a recovery part? It is about 20 gb

•
yes of course

•
when i attempt to restore to factory on MyAsusRe but the computer restarts after the "Check Compatibly OK"

Volume 0 C OS NTFS Partition 453 GB Healthy Boot

Volume 1 RESTORE NTFS Partition 22 GB Healthy

Volume 2 SYSTEM FAT32 Partition 100 MB Healthy System

Volume 3 RECOVERY NTFS Partition 700 MB Healthy Hidden

Volume 4 MYASUS FAT32 Partition 200 MB Healthy Hidden

You must have these partitions on your disk Only after this did everything work for me look through diskpart -> sel disk* -> list vol

Bro i love you, months of searching for this solution lol, the recovery partition had no label after updating windows a long time ago, for anyone looking how to rename it on windows 11 without having to use cmd promt you can do it in;

System settings -> Storage -> Disk and volumes, there should be a partition with no label.

Once again, thank you very much.

•
If it doesn't work, then I have no more idea

Done brother! I managed to factory restore my laptop, thanks to that information you shared with me I realized that my failure was that my recovery disk was not labeled, so I renamed it to "RECOVERY" and that's it! Truly my most sincere words of thanks to you, whoever you are and wherever you are, thank you for taking your time to answer me and help me! I send you a big fraternal hug and my best wishes for you.

•
I was glad to help, and I’m very glad that everything worked out for you)

•
what did you do and how

•
I have this same issue, how do you renane the Volume to Label RECOVERY?

•
That's another upvote and thank you from me too.

Even though it was staring me right in the face I didn't clock that my recovery volume didn't have any label set until I stumbled upon and read your comment.

All worked exactly as it should once I'd set this to 'RECOVERY'.

   * RECOVERY partition should have `Recovery/WindowsRE/ReAgent.xml`
   * RESTORE partition should have `Recovery/RecoveryImage/ASUS.swm`

   * Set the label of `C:` drive to `OS`
   * Make sure the label of recovery, restore, myasus is correctly set to `RECOVERY, RESTORE, MYASUS`
   * Set the name of system partition to `SYSTEM` (sometimes has a blank label, this partition should contain `EFI` folder and is around 100MB in size)

* Link Windows Recovery Environment to `RECOVERY` partition
   * Search for command prompt and run it as administrator and execute the following commands:
      * `diskpart`
      * `list disk`
      * `select disk #`  (probably disk 0)
      * `list vol`
      * `select vol #`  (select the `RECOVERY` partition)
      * `assign letter=x`
      * `exit`
    
      <img width="554" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-16 122859-min" src="https://github.com/mjishnu/Fix-MyAsus-In-WinRE/assets/83004520/1c414d4d-2dd4-4f48-b7e7-01e10003d092">
   * Next, navigate in Windows Explorer to `C:\windows\system32\Recovery` DELETE or RENAME the file `ReAgent.xml`
   * Go back to the elevated command prompt and execute the following commands:
      * `reagentc /disable`  (just in case it's enabled with the wrong image, likely not)
      * `reagentc /setreimage /path x:\Recovery\WindowsRE /target C:\Windows`
      * `reagentc /enable`
      * `diskpart`
      * `list disk`
      * `select disk #`  (probably disk 0)
      * `list vol`
      * `select vol #`  (select the `RECOVERY` partition)
      * `remove letter=x`
      * `exit`

## Restore RECOVERY, RESTORE, MYASUS partitions

* For this to work we need to acquire donor backup images of MYASUS, RESTORE, RECOVERY partitions ideally from someone with the same device.
   * To create backup image ask the donor to follow this guide: [How to Backup Partition to Image File](https://www.diskgenius.com/manual/partition-backup.php)
   * If no donor available and you have RESTORE partition intact you can try using this backup image. The file format, partition size and link are given below (**EXPERIMENTAL NOT TESTED**) 
      * MYASUS partition \[FAT32, 200MB\]: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1utA8hrVOf7s10cC5dd0eqMBdIXuT9id6/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1utA8hrVOf7s10cC5dd0eqMBdIXuT9id6/view?usp=sharing) 
      * RECOVERY partition \[NTFS, 700 MB\] (**HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL**) : [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fb5E8ffKV2C-t8K5khG5SrvRO9xrmik5/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fb5E8ffKV2C-t8K5khG5SrvRO9xrmik5/view?usp=sharing)
* [Create partitions](https://softwarekeep.com/en-in/blogs/how-to/how-to-create-partitions-on-windows-10) with same size and file format as the donor (ask donor for the size and file format of the partition) for me RESTORE partition is around 22GB (22\*1024 MB)
* On the newly created partition restore the backup image: [Restore Partition from Backup Image File](https://www.diskgenius.com/manual/restore-partition-from-img.php)

* PMF - Partition Image File - DiskGenius

Restore Partition from Image File
When partition gets damaged, corrupted or files in the partition gets lost, you can try restoring partition from the backup image file to rescue data.
