Fix MyAsus in WinRE
Ensure that BitLocker is turned off

Download DiskGenius

Ensure you have RECOVERY, RESTORE, MYASUS partition (if you don't have, try this)

RECOVERY partition should have Recovery/WindowsRE/ReAgent.xml
RESTORE partition should have Recovery/RecoveryImage/ASUS.swm
MYASUS partition should have AsusWinRE/AsusWinRE.idx Screenshot 2024-06-16 123050-min
In some cases the name of partition might be different or multiple partitions exist in that case explore all partition through DiskGenius and look for the files mentioned above
Assign proper label to following partitions (case sensitive)

To set label, in DiskGenius select the partition you want to rename right click --> set volume name --> type the proper name in the textbox --> hit ok Screenshot 2024-06-16 123304-min
Set the label of C: drive to OS
Make sure the label of recovery, restore, myasus is correctly set to RECOVERY, RESTORE, MYASUS
Set the name of system partition to SYSTEM (sometimes has a blank label, this partition should contain EFI folder and is around 100MB in size)

Restore RECOVERY, RESTORE, MYASUS partitions
For this to work we need to acquire donor backup images of MYASUS, RESTORE, RECOVERY partitions ideally from someone with the same device.
To create backup image ask the donor to follow this guide: How to Backup Partition to Image File
If no donor available and you have RESTORE partition intact you can try using this backup image. The file format, partition size and link are given below (EXPERIMENTAL NOT TESTED)
MYASUS partition [FAT32, 200MB]: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1utA8hrVOf7s10cC5dd0eqMBdIXuT9id6/view?usp=sharing
RECOVERY partition [NTFS, 700 MB] (HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL) : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fb5E8ffKV2C-t8K5khG5SrvRO9xrmik5/view?usp=sharing
Create partitions with same size and file format as the donor (ask donor for the size and file format of the partition) for me RESTORE partition is around 22GB (22*1024 MB)
On the newly created partition restore the backup image: Restore Partition from Backup Image File
