In `password reset`:
this password tool can reset " Windows password & Pin " -- but not for Bitlocker 
make sure your hard drive is disable Bitlocker

if hard drive is enable Bitlocker, then password tool will not be able to access hard drive, 
it will not display windows account, because the Bitlocker has already locked the hard drive, 
no software can access it, so the password tool can do nothing
