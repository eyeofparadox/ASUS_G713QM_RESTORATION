What is Realtek Semiconductor Corp?
https://www.realtek.com

Realtek as an Audio Chipset Manufacturer:
Realtek is a major manufacturer of audio chipsets, which are integrated into many motherboards and sound cards. 

Why is Realtek on my computer?

Realtek is likely on your computer because your motherboard or sound card uses a Realtek audio chipset, and the corresponding drivers are installed to enable your computer to communicate with that hardware and play sound. 

Here's a more detailed explanation:

Drivers for Audio Functionality:
- These chipsets require drivers to function with your operating system (like Windows). These drivers allow your computer to send and receive audio signals to and from the chipset. 

Common in Desktops and Laptops:
- Realtek audio solutions are very common in both desktop computers and laptops, as they are often included as part of the motherboard's integrated audio capabilities. 

Realtek Audio Console:
- Some Realtek drivers come with an application called the Realtek Audio Console, which allows you to adjust audio settings and device effects. 

Not part of Windows:
- Realtek is not part of windows, but is a manufacturer of audio chips and drivers for motherboards. 

OEM's responsibility:
- It is the manufacturer of your system that decides the appropriate software for your Audio devices (both input and output) on your PC.

Where to download the Realtek Audio Console?
- AI Overview

To download the Realtek Audio Console, you need to install the Realtek audio driver from your computer manufacturer's website and then open the Microsoft Store, where the Realtek Audio Console will be "automatically" bought for you. 

Realtek Audio Console is considered a private app, so it doesn't show up in the microsoft store "search". You CANNOT search for it. It is to prevent people trying to install the app on a computer with "legacy" realtek audio drivers (i.e. those that came with realtek hd audio manager). All those 1 star ratings on the Microsoft Store saying that they couldn't install the app --- that's because they have "legacy" audio drivers.

So if it is "missing", then it is because the end-users didn't install the new DCH driver correctly or that they have legacy audio driver (and shouldn't install it anyway).

Unable to download Realtek Audio Console! 
- Forum summary

This is not a microsoft store issue. If you want the technical answer, installing via device manager method will not install the extension inf file. You have to install DCH drivers (post 2018 windows drivers) using the installer exe (often called setup.exe). 

- You CANNOT install DCH drivers by device manager.

- After you install your computer manufacturer's realtek audio driver, then run Microsoft Store --- the realtek audio console will be "automatically" bought for you. You cannot install other computer manufacturer's realtek audio driver onto your computer

Only using the installer exe will the extension inf file installs the 3 realtek software components. If you don't have these 3 software components installed, then you will have problems getting realtek audio console from the microsoft store. Errors in the installation will bring you these problems --- sometimes asus and msi tell people to kill their internet access and reinstall their drivers.

The screenshot is clearly telling you that the problem is on THEIR end. If your motherboard provides an offline realtek audio console app installation download, then install it the offline way. You can also try to clear the microsoft store cache or reset your microsoft store app.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

Install the Realtek Audio Driver

Go to your computer manufacturer's website (e.g., Dell, HP, MSI, etc.):
- Find the support section for your specific computer model. 
- Locate and download the Realtek audio driver for your operating system (Windows 10 or 11). 

Open the Microsoft Store:
- After installing the driver, open the Microsoft Store. 
- The Realtek Audio Console should be automatically installed and available for use. 

Troubleshooting
- If you encounter issues downloading from the Microsoft Store, search for "Realtek Audio Control" in the store. 
- You can also check the installed apps in the store library. 
- If you still can't find it, try uninstalling and reinstalling the Realtek audio driver. 
- Some users have reported success with the Realtek Audio Control offline installer available on GitHub.

In some reported cases, it has to be a UAD driver in order to work:

Realtek UAD Driver 6.0.9575.1
https://www.techspot.com/drivers/downloadnow/18228/?evp=9685f2b105f5930635f426f660bba43c&file=25516
- A third-party modification of Realtek drivers for older computers that support Realtek Legacy HDA FF00 drivers.

More about this driver
- Compatibility: This Realtek UAD driver mod should install and function properly on all systems supporting Realtek Legacy HDA FF00 drivers that don't rely on any special audio enhancements. If used with devices relying on special audio enhancements functionality and feature set available may be limited.

Project motivation
- I have an old system that is not supported by OEM specific Realtek UAD drivers and I found HDA drivers to be very large, bloated and causing an unpleasant issue when equalizer was installed that was a pain to live with. Realtek UAD generic drivers were not affected so I permanently switched to them. But Realtek doesn't provide complete and official UAD generic drivers very often so I decided to custom craft it from parts since I discovered it is possible to do so without breaking WHQL signature.
