##### AI Overview

Based on the provided information, the SHA256 checksum 

D20EB130D8574F6C5F45791D63E487F382A227420A8429D9AAB2727165610E11 is not listed as a confirmed SHA256 hash for the official Windows 11 23H2 English x64 ISO. 

Here's why:

* The official SHA256 checksum for the English 64-bit Windows 11 23H2 ISO is listed as 36DE5ECB7A0DAA58DCE68C03B9465A543ED0F5498AA8AE60AB45FB7C8C4AE402.

* Another listed SHA256 checksum for the English International 64-bit version is 705AC061688FFD7F5721DA844D01DF85433856EAFAA8441ECE94B270685CA2DB. 

It is important to note:

* Checksums are crucial for verifying the integrity and authenticity of downloaded files.

* If your downloaded ISO file's SHA256 checksum does not match the official checksum, it indicates that the file may be corrupted, incomplete, or potentially tampered with.

* If the checksum doesn't match, you should delete the downloaded file and obtain a fresh copy from a trusted source, such as the official Microsoft website. 

To verify the SHA256 checksum of your downloaded ISO file:

You can use the built-in Command Prompt or PowerShell in Windows: 

* Command Prompt:

  * Open Command Prompt by pressing Windows+R, typing cmd, and pressing Enter.

  * Run the command: certutil \-hashfile \<path\_to\_your\_ISO\_file\> SHA256 (replace \<path\_to\_your\_ISO\_file\> with the actual path to your downloaded file).

* PowerShell:

  * Open PowerShell by pressing Windows+R, typing powershell, and pressing Enter.

  * Run the command: Get-FileHash \<path\_to\_your\_ISO\_file\> \-Algorithm SHA256 (replace \<path\_to\_your\_ISO\_file\> with the actual path to your downloaded file). 

Compare the generated SHA256 hash with the official one. If they don't match, download the ISO file again.
